# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Forecasting
The objective of this project is to develop an accurate CLV forecasting model that estimates the future value of each customer based on historical data. By understanding the expected lifetime value of individual policyholders, the auto insurance company can tailor its marketing efforts, retention strategies, and personalized offers.
